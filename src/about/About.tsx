            <p>The English Premier League is the top football league in England. It includes 20 clubs across England. Each season, the bottom three clubs according to total points are relegated to the league below, and the top three clubs from the league below get promoted to the Premier League. This relegation system keeps the league competitive, and gives clubs the opportunity to 'climb' the English football pyramid to get to the Premier League.</p>
