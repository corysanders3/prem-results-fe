        name: 'Leicester City Win the League at 5,000-1 Odds!',
        year: 2016,
        story: `Leicester finished the previous season barely avoiding relegation by winning 3 of their last 4 games. Needless to say, it appeared unlikely that they would remain in the Premier League much longer, and were given the highest odds out of all Premier League clubs to be relegated coming into the 2015-2016 season. The goal was set by new manager Claudio Ranieri to hit 40 points, which is typically enough to avoid relegation. Behind the 24 goals from Jamie Vardy and 17 from Riyad Mahrez, Leicester City surprised pundits and fans alike, by finishing top of the league. Absolutely embodying the quote ‘Against All Odds.’ Click the link below to checkout a documentary, taking you through Leicester’s journey to becoming champions.`,

        story: `Heading into the final game of the 2012 season , Manchester City and Manchester United were level at the top of the table with 86 points. Manchester City was sitting first, only due to a higher goal difference. The stage was set, City would win the league with at home against Queens Park Rangers. United would win the league with a win, and a City loss or draw. Bitter rivals facing off in the final game of the season, without actually playing each other. As the 90th min hit, City was losing 1-2, and would need 2 goals as United had just secured their win. The first game at 90+2, with an Edin Dzeko header. Only +5 min was given, so City had to rush… and with one minute left, Sergio Augero dribbled past one opponent and slotted in the game and title winning goal, giving us the iconic call of ‘Agueroooooo!!’ Click the link below to watch the final minutes of that game.`,

        year: 2004,
        story: `There had not been a season where a club went unbeaten in over 100 years up until this point. Arenal manager Arsene Wenger set the bar high coming into the season, being quoted ‘I want to win every game.’ Arsenal had a top squad with the likes of Sol Campbell, Thierry Henry, Patrick Viera, Ashley Cole, and the list goes on. But an unbeaten season… is a tall order. With 5 games left in the season, they were still unbeaten and were heading to White Hart Lane to face off against their rival Tottenham. With only one point needed to secure the league title, Arsenal drew 2-2 and were able to celebrate the championship on their rivals ground. ‘Invincible’ was not yet done though. Arsenal were able to remain unbeaten in the last 4 games and ended with a record of 26 wins, 12 draws, and 0 losses, giving us the first unbeaten season in over 100 years.
